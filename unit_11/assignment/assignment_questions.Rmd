# Question 1a (1pt)
For this question, we will use soybean yields measured across multiple locations in six states in the 1930s and 1940s.  This is part of the same dataset you used in the practices for multiple linear regression
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
thompson_soy = read.csv("data/thompson_soy.csv")
head(thompson_soy)
```

Model yield as a function of all four weather measurements.
```{r}

```

# Question 1b (1pt)
Report the coefficient values using the tidy() function.
```{r}
library(broom)

```

# Question 1c (1 pt)
Report the model fit statistics
```{r}

```

# Question 1d (1 pt)
Examine the covariance matrix.  Do any of the predictor variables appear to be related?  Name one pair.
```{r}

```

# Question 1e (1 pt)
Observe the correlation among the predictor variables using the partial correlation matrix.  Do any of the predictor variables seem correlated?  Name one pair.

```{r}
library(ppcor)

```

# Question 1f (2.5 pt).
Cross validate the model and print the model results.  
```{r}
library(caret)

set.seed(123)
train.control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                              number = 10, repeats = 3)

# Fill in the remaining code
```



# Question 2a (1.5 pt)
```{r}
tomato = read.csv("data/tomato_days_volume.csv")
head(tomato)
```


Plot the original data.
```{r}

```

# Question 2c (2 pt)  
Run and summarize a logistic model of fruit_volume as a function of days.
```{r}

```

# Question 2d (2 pt)
Create a new dataset, tomato predicted, with days ranging from 7 to 49, in increments of 1.
```{r}

```

# Question 2e (1 pt)
Predict the fruit volume for each day increment in the "tomato_predicted" dataset
```{r}

```

# Question 2f (1 pt)
Add the modelled curve to the initial plot.
```{r}

```
