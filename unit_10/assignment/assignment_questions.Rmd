```{r}
library(tidyverse)
weed = read.csv("data/wheat_weed_india.csv")
head(weed)
```

# Question 1a (1 pt)
Create a scatterplot matrix for the *weed* dataset.
```{r}

```

# Question 1b (1 pt)
Create a correlation matrix showing the correlation counts for all the variables.
```{r}

```

# Question 1c (1 pt)
Create a scatterplot for the association between total_weed_dm and yield.
```{r}

```

# Question 1d (1 pt)
Test the correlation betwewen total_weed_dm and yield using the *cor.test() function*
```{r}

```

# Question 1e (1.5 pt)
Describe the relationship between total_weed_dm and yield:

* Is it strong?
* Is it positive or negative?
* How would you explain it in "plain" language?


# Question 2a (2pt)
Create a regression model of yield as a function of total_weed_pop.  Display the results using the *tidy()* function

```{r}
library(broom)

```

# Question 2b (1pt)
Display the r.square and other statistics using the *glance()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 2b (1.5pt)
What can you conclude about the effect of total_weed_pop on yield?

* Is it positive or negative?
* Is it significant?
* Based on the r.squared, what percentage of the variation in yield is explained by variation in total_weed_pop?


# Question 2c (1pt)
Plot the model residuals.
```{r}

```

# Question 2d (1pt)
What does the residual plot above tell us about the appropriateness of fitting our data with a linear model?

# Question 2e (1.5)
Use the *geom_smooth()* function with ggplot() to plot a regression line on the relationship between total_weed_pop and yield.
```{r}

```


# Question 2f (1.5 pt)

Using the *new_weed_pops* data frame below, predict the yield based on the five weed populations given, and show the results.

```{r}
new_weed_pops = data.frame(
  total_weed_pop = c(-1, 1, 3, 5, 7)
)

```
