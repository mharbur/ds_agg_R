Ah, your first Assignment in Agronomy 513. You may be experiencing excitement and joy of learning -- or terror and loss of bowel control -- depending on prior experiences with statistics or coding. Remember, this is not an exam. You are allowed to ask me for help. If you have revisited the lecture and exercises and are still stuck -- please drop me an email.

# Question 1a.

Load the shapefile "data/elkhart_ia_yield_map/elkhart_ia_yield_map.shp" using the *st_read()* function, and assign it to the data frame "soybean"

```{r}
library(sf) # ignore this
library(tidyverse) # ignore this

soybean = st_read("data/elkhart_ia_yield_map/elkhart_ia_yield_map.shp")


```

# Question 1b

Review the structure of the "soybean" data frame using the *head()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 1c

Plot the yield map using the *plot()* function. Remember you need to designate the column to plot.

```{r}

```

# Question 1d

Create a histogram of the yield using the *hist()* function.

```{r}

```

# Question 1e

Calculate the mean yield.

```{r}

```

# Question 1f

Calculate the median yield

```{r}

```

# Question 1g

Calculate the standard deviation for yield.

```{r}

```

#Question 2a

Load the planting map "data/moline_il_planting_map/moline_il_planting_map.shp".

```{r}

```

# Question 2b

Inspect the data using the *head()* function.

```{r}


```

# Question 2c

Map the column "AppldRt", which measures the actual planting rate.

```{r}

```

# Question 2d

Create an histogram for the actual planting rate using the *hist()* function.

```{r}

```

#Question 2e What was the mean actual planting rate?

```{r}

```

# Question 2f

What was the minimum actual rate planted?

```{r}

```

# Question 2g

The standard deviation can be used to gauge the consistency of the planting rate. What was the standard deviation of the actual planting rate?

```{r}

```
